    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Ravi Jethva and am new to the Philadelphia area.
Philly is definitely a big change from Houston. I enjoy basketball and exploring the city. 
I have a dog named Zoey and a cat named Arya. I can honestly say I've never seen a more friendly cat/dog relationship.
Hope you enjoy my page!</p>
